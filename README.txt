First off, congratulations on making it to this stage of our interviewing
process!  We look forward to meeting with you in person, and would like to
see an example of your work to help us in understanding your coding style 
and level of understanding.
 
We have two excercises for you to complete and submit to us.  The first is 
a simple code kata.  You will find the Problem description in the Minesweeper
solution folder.  Please add any projects you need to complete the kata 
to the Minsweeper solution folder. Please ensure that you have a working
console application and a unit test project that excercises your code at
a bare minimum.  The second excercise can be found in the Refactor solution
folder.  Feel free to refactor the existing projects in any way you see fit
to improve the maintainabilty, readbility and architecture of the existing 
code.  The code in this exercise is intentionally obscure.
 
Once you have completed both excercises to your satisfaction, please ZIP
up the entire solution and email it to:
 
rhardy@scramsystems.com
 
You can also use that email if you have any problems or questions.
 
Thank You!
AMS Net Dev Team
