First off, congratulations on making it to this stage of our interviewing
process!  We look forward to meeting with you in person, and would like to
see an example of your work to help us in understanding your coding style 
and level of understanding.
 
We have three excercises for you to complete and submit to us:

The first is green field development project.  You will find the Problem 
Description in the ComplianceMapper solution folder.  Please add any projects 
you need to complete the excercise to the ComplianceMapper solution folder. 
Please ensure that you have a working console application and a unit test 
project that excercises your code at a bare minimum.  Feel free to add
addisional projects as needed.

The second excercise can be found in the Refactor solution folder.  Feel free 
to refactor the existing projects in any way you see fit to improve the 
maintainabilty, readbility and architecture of the existing code.  The code 
in this exercise is intentionally obscure.

The third excercise challenges you to find and fix a bug in a simple web
project.  The details of the bug can be found in the Problem Description
text file in the web project.  
 
Once you have completed the excercises to your satisfaction, please do a 
clean on your solution to remove any binaries, ZIP up the entire solution 
and email it to:
 
rhardy@scramsystems.com
 
You can also use that email if you have any problems or questions.
 
Thank You!
